Good afternoon! I'm Jiang Wenxin, a phd student at CityUHK major in biostatistics.
I'm sure many of you have noticed that Python 3.14 has officially landed. Let's do a quick pulse
check—by a show of hands, how many of you have already glanced through the release notes?

Here’s the core idea: Python now follows a predictable annual release cycle, with a major version arriving every
October—and the latest one is already here. If you take away just one URL from this talk, let it be the official Python
versions page. That page is your go-to compass for understanding what's new, what's improved, and what's being phased
out.

My goal today is simple: I want to get you excited about staying up to date with each release—and maybe even inspire you
to try new features early.
To make that happen, we’ll walk through some of the most impactful changes introduced between Python 3.10 and 3.14.
Along the way, you’ll get a feel for how the release notes are structured year after year—and how the core development
team, alongside a dedicated community of contributors, continuously refines Python: smoothing out rough edges, boosting
performance, and making it more enjoyable to use in real-world projects.

  <h3>Release Rhythm · Where We Are</h3>

  </p>
  <aside class="notes">
Let's take a moment to focus on the timeline. Since Python 3.9, the project has settled into a predictable yearly
release cadence, with a new major version arriving every October.

Each version goes through a clear lifecycle, and you can track these phases on the official Python versions page—this
chart is a direct snapshot of that page. Each row represents a release branch, and the blue line marks where we are
today, with 3.14 freshly released.

New features are introduced during the feature phase. Then comes pre-release, when the feature set is locked but the team
still accepts bug fixes. After that, the bug fix phase begins, delivering regular maintenance updates. Later, the branch
moves into security-only mode, accepting only critical security patches. Finally, the version reaches end-of-life and is
officially frozen.

If you ever need to check the status of any Python version, this single URL tells you exactly where each release stands.

  </p>
  <aside class="notes">
To keep up with Python's rapid evolution, you need to know about two key resources: the "What's New" pages
and PEPs. The "What's New" documentation is your essential guide for each release—it summarizes all the important changes in an
accessible way. And when you want to understand the deep technical details or design philosophy behind any feature,
that's when you turn to its PEP—the Python Enhancement Proposal.

Here's how an idea becomes a Python feature: It usually starts with discussion on public forums. If there's enough
community interest, someone will draft a PEP—a comprehensive design document. They find a core developer to sponsor it,
then submit it as a pull request to the PEPs repository. A PEP editor assigns it a number and checks the formatting.
Then the real work begins: open discussion, iteration, and refinement. For standards-track changes, the proposal
eventually goes to the Steering Council for a final decision. This open process is a core strength of the Python ecosystem.

    <strong>Tip:</strong> Start with highlights → New Features → [your interests].
  </p>
  <aside class="notes">
To navigate any Python release, you only need two resources: the 'What's New' docs and PEPs.
Think of the 'What's New' page as your roadmap. ​​Start with the 'Highlights'​​ for a quick overview. ​​Then dive into
'New Features'​​ for the deep dive on what matters to you—like new syntax, optimizations, or typing improvements.
Everything else, from deprecated modules to C API changes, is neatly organized if you need it.
For the full story behind any feature, that's where ​​PEPs​​ come in. They're the formal
design documents that explain the 'why' and the 'how'.
So remember: Highlights → New Features → your interests. That's all you need to stay up to date.

  <h3>3.10 · New syntax feature:<br>  Structural Pattern Matching</h3>
  Declarative <em>match/case</em> replaces nested if/elif
  <pre><code class="hljs python">def http_error(status):
    match status:
        case 400:
          return "Bad request"
        case 401 | 403 | 404:
          return "Not allowed"
        case _: # wildcard
          return "Something's wrong"</code></pre>
  <p style="font-size:0.6em">
    Docs: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.10/whatsnew/3.10.html" target="_blank">What’s New in 3.10</a> ·
    PEPs: <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0634/" target="_blank">PEP 634</a>, <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0635/" target="_blank">635</a>, <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0636/" target="_blank">636</a>.
  </p>
  <aside class="notes">
Now, as we continue down the ​​What's New in Python 3.10​​ page, we get to one of the headline features: ​​Structural
Pattern Matching​​.
Basically, it's a much cleaner way to handle complex conditional logic—you know, those long if/elif/else chains we've
all written. Instead of writing a bunch of instructions, you just declare the patterns you want to match against your
data.
Look at this example: you can match a single value, like 400, or combine several with a bar, and that underscore
_ acts as a catch-all wildcard. It makes the code so much more readable.
For all the details on how it works, the specification, and the tutorial, you can find the links to PEPs 634, 635, and
636 right here.

  <h3>3.10 · New typing feature:<br>Union Types</h3>
  <pre><code class="hljs python"># before
from typing import Union
def fun(x: Union[str, bytes]):
# after
def f(x: str | bytes):
  </code></pre>
  <p style="font-size:0.6em">
    Docs: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.10/whatsnew/3.10.html" target="_blank">What's New in 3.10</a> ·

  </p>
  <aside class="notes">
Alright, moving on to another great quality-of-life improvement in the typing system: the new ​​Union Types​​ syntax.
You know how we used to have to import Union and write things like Union[str, bytes]? It worked, but it was a bit
verbose.
Now, you can just use a clean vertical bar | like you see here. So str | bytes does the exact same thing. It's much more
concise and honestly, it just reads more naturally.
And the best part is, this new syntax isn't just for type hints. You can also use it directly in isinstance() checks,
making it really versatile.
For all the details on this change and other typing updates, the links to PEP 604 and the others are right here.

  </p>
  <aside class="notes">
Now we come to what's probably the most anticipated change in Python 3.13: the ​​free-threaded interpreter​​, which
makes the Global Interpreter Lock optional.
For decades, the GIL has been Python's famous limitation—it ensures only one thread can execute Python code at a time,
which limited true parallelism.
With this new free-threaded mode, CPU-bound threads can finally run in parallel across multiple cores. This means
better utilization of modern hardware without the overhead of multiprocessing.
But this power comes with trade-offs. Single-threaded performance might see a slight dip due to added synchronization,
and existing C extensions will need updates to work safely. Memory usage also increases slightly.
So it's a game-changer for specific workloads, particularly CPU-intensive parallel tasks, while I/O bound applications
may not see as much benefit. It's an exciting step forward that opens up new possibilities for Python performance."

  </p>
  <aside class="notes">
Alright, moving on to Python 3.14, which solidifies two major advancements for parallelism. First, PEP 779 makes
free-threaded Python officially supported—it's no longer experimental, though still optional. This gives you the
confidence to pilot it in CPU-bound scenarios without worrying about it being deprecated.
Second, PEP 734 introduces multiple interpreters in the standard library, allowing you to run isolated Python
environments within the same process. This enables true multi-core parallelism with minimal overhead, perfect for
scaling out workloads.
